# Advanced Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an Advanced Sentiment Analysis Dashboard built using Streamlit and LangChain. It leverages various Large Language Models (LLMs) through Ollama to perform sentiment analysis on user-provided text or batch inputs via CSV files.

For a detailed guide on how this project was built, check out the article:

## Features
- Single text and batch sentiment analysis
- Multiple LLM model selection (including TinyLlama, Llama2, Phi3, Mistral, and many more)
- Interactive visualizations:
  - Sentiment gauge charts
  - Word clouds
  - Overall sentiment distribution bar charts
- Batch analysis with CSV file upload
